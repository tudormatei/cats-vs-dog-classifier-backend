## Quick intro

Hello and thank you for your interest in my project! This is the backend part of a two-repo application. The other part can be found [here](https://github.com/marcspataru/cats-vs-dogs)

## Prerequisites

In order to run this app, you will need Anaconda installed on your machine.
You will also need a Chrome extension (download [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf)) to run the project, since there were some problems in sending/receiving requests between two applications that run on localhost.

## How to run the project

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build and run the server in production mode:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Run the server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to see the flask server running.
